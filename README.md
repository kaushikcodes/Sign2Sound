# Sign2Sound
Sign2Sound is a device that uses computer vision and machine learning to translate the 24 stationary alphabets of the American Sign Language. It is a semi-portable ASL translator, which includes the device itself and a color-coded right-handed glove. As a predecessor to a more advanced device, Sign2Sound only recognizes the 24 stationary letters of the ASL alphabet for a right-handed individual. First, the device streams feedback from a camera to a screen, allowing the user to frame their gloved hand properly. The glove is used to standardize differences in the users’ hand shape, size, and color and make sign identification easier. Once the user is ready, they can press a button to trigger image capture. The image is processed on a RaspberryPi that houses a team-designed computer vision algorithm, associating signs with their English alphabet translation. Then, the translation is sent to our microcontroller via UART. With the identified letter data, the microcontroller manages two forms of output, audio and visual. For the audio output, the microcontroller transmits the identified letter’s audio file to a DAC via I2C. Subsequently, the converted analog signal is output from the DAC to a speaker using a team-designed amplifier circuit. As for the visual output, the microcontroller transmits the identified letter to an OLED LCD display via SPI. The device will be powered by a wall wart transformer, supplying 5V directly to the RaspberryPi. Power will be fed from the RaspberryPi to a LDO to reduce the voltage to 3.3V for the microcontroller.

The machine learning algorithm that we use to classify our image data is LDA. LDA or Linear Discriminative Analysis is a self-supervised machine learning model that is ideal for image based multi-class classification problems. After weeks of data collection, data augmentation, and model training, we were able to attain an accuracy of over 88.5%. I have attached the confusion matrix of our model below:
